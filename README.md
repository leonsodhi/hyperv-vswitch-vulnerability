Hyper-V vswitch Vulnerability
============================

A version of the exploit explained under CORE-2011-0203 including a driver to read and write kernel memory.


Usage
=====

Compile the driver using the Windows DDK, load it using OSRLOADER, tweak the exploit as needed (the memory addr for the exploit has been hard coded as I think the find pattern function sometimes failed but you can uncomment it if needed). Finally, build the app and run it (no params required). 

If all goes well, when you go to reboot or shutdown the VM it will hang and even the Hyper-V management console won't be able to kill it.
